`Introduction`

# Subdivisions

Ireland has traditionally been divided into four provinces, each divided into several counties, or _contaetha_:

- Connacht
  - Galway `G`
  - Leitrim `LM`
  - Mayo `MO`
  - Roscommon `RN`
  - Sligo `SO`
- Leinster
  - Carlow `CW`
  - Dublin `D`
    - Dublin City
    - Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown
    - Fingal
    - South Dublin
  - Kildare `KE`
  - Kilkenny `KK`
  - Laois `LS`
  - Longford `LD`
  - Louth `LH`
  - Meath `MH`
  - Offaly `OY`
  - Westmeath `WH`
  - Wexford `WX`
  - Wicklow `WW`
- Munster
  - Clare `CE`
  - Cork `C`
  - Kerry `KY`
  - Limerick `L`
  - Tipperary `T`
  - Waterford `W`
- Ulster
  - Antrim _NI_
  - Armagh _NI_
  - Cavan `CN`
  - Donegal `DL`
  - Down _NI_
  - Fermanagh _NI_
  - Londonderry _NI_
  - Monaghan `MN`
  - Tyrone _NI_

Counties labeled _NI_ are in Northern Ireland, which is a part of the [United Kingdom](/countries/GBR). The word "county" is usually prefixed to the county's name rather than suffixed; thus it would be _County Sligo_, and not _Sligo County_. Galway and Cork are separate entities from Counties Galway and Sligo, respectively In addition, County Dublin was split up into three city-level counties in addition to Dublin City itself.

# License Plates

As a member of the EU, Ireland's license plates feature a blue band on the left side of the plate with the EU circle of stars and the country code `IRL`. Plates are white with black text: <LicensePlate style="eu" code="IRL" format="123-AB-45678"/>. The one or two letters in between represent the county of registration, the codes for which can be found in the [Subdivisions](#subdivisions) list above. These codes are typically the first and last letters of the county's name, with some exceptions.
