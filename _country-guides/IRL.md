# Subdivisions

Ireland has traditionally been divided into four provinces, each divided into several counties, or _contaetha_:

- Connacht
  - `G` Galway
  - `LM` Leitrim
  - `MO` Mayo
  - `RN` Roscommon
  - `SO` Sligo
- Leinster
  - `CW` Carlow
  - `D` Dublin
    - Dublin City
    - Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown
    - Fingal
    - South Dublin
  - `KE` Kildare
  - `KK` Kilkenny
  - `LS` Laois
  - `LD` Longford
  - `LH` Louth
  - `MH` Meath
  - `OY` Offaly
  - `WH` Westmeath
  - `WX` Wexford
  - `WW` Wicklow
- Munster
  - `CE` Clare
  - `C` Cork
  - `KY` Kerry
  - `L` Limerick
  - `T` Tipperary
  - `W` Waterford
- Ulster
  - Antrim _NI_
  - Armagh _NI_
  - `CN` Cavan
  - `DL` Donegal
  - Down _NI_
  - Fermanagh _NI_
  - Londonderry _NI_
  - `MN` Monaghan
  - Tyrone _NI_

Counties labeled _NI_ are in Northern Ireland, which is a part of the [United Kingdom](/countries/GBR). The word "county" is usually prefixed to the county's name rather than suffixed; thus it would be _County Sligo_, and not _Sligo County_. Galway and Cork are separate entities from Counties Galway and Sligo, respectively. In addition, County Dublin was split up into three city-level counties in addition to Dublin City itself.

# License Plates

As a member of the EU, Ireland's license plates feature a blue band on the left side of the plate with the EU circle of stars and the country code `IRL`. Plates are white with black text: <LicensePlate style="eu" code="IRL" format="123-AB-45678"/>. The one or two letters in between represent the county of registration, the codes for which can be found in the [Subdivisions](#subdivisions) list above. These codes are typically the first and last letters of the county's name, with some exceptions.

# Phone Codes

Phone numbers in Ireland are geographically organized, but don't always follow county borders. Phone numbers are typically prefixed with a zero (0):

1. Dublin
2. Cork
3. `NA`
4. East, Midlands, and North
5. Midlands and Southeast
6. Southwest
7. Northwest
8. _Mobile_
9. West
