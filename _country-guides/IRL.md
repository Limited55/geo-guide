`Introduction`

# Subdivisions

Ireland has traditionally been divided into four provinces, each divided into several counties, or _contaetha_:

- Connacht
  - Galway `C`
  - Leitrim
  - Mayo
  - Roscommon
  - Sligo
- Leinster
  - Carlow
  - Dublin
    - DÃºn Laoghaire-Rathdown
    - Fingal
    - South Dublin
  - Kildare
  - Kilkenny
  - Laois
  - Longford
  - Louth
  - Meath
  - Offaly
  - Westmeath
  - Wexford
  - Wicklow
- Munster
  - Clare
  - Cork `C`
  - Kerry
  - Limerick
  - Tipperary
  - Waterford
- Ulster
  - Antrim `NI`
  - Armagh `NI`
  - Cavan
  - Donegal
  - Down `NI`
  - Fermanagh `NI`
  - Londonderry `NI`
  - Monaghan
  - Tyrone `NI`

Counties labeled `NI` are in Northern Ireland, which is a part of the [United Kingdom](/countries/GBR). The word "county" is usually prefixed to the county's name rather than suffixed; thus it would be _County Sligo_, and not _Sligo County_. In counties labeled `C`, the city by the same name is a separate county-level entity as the county itself. And Dublin was split up into three city-level counties in addition to Dublin City itself.

# License Plates

As a member of the EU, Ireland's license plates feature a blue band on the left side of the plate with the EU circle of stars and the country code `IRL`. Plates are white with black text: <LicensePlate style="eu" code="IRL" format="123-AB-45678"/>. The one or two letters in between represent the county of registration.
