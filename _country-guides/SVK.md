# License Plates

As a member of the EU, Slovakia's license plates feature a blue band on the left side of the plate with the EU circle of stars and the country code `SK`. Plates are white with black text: <LicensePlate style="eu" code="SK" format="AB∇123CD"/>. The first one or two letters represent the district of registration, and is followed by the coat of arms of Slovakia (represented by a `∇` above).
