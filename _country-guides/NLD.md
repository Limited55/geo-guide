Welcome to the land of tulips, bicycles, and dams! The Netherlands is easily distinguishable from the rest of Europe thanks to flat terrain, distinctive license plates, and the aforementioned abundance of bicycles. Read on to learn more about the Netherlands in GeoGuessr!

# Subdivisions

The Netherlands is comprised of the following twelve provinces:

- Drenthe `DR`
- Flevoland `FL`
- Friesland/Frysl√¢n `FR`
- Gelderland `GE`
- Groningen `GR`
- Limburg `LI`
- Noord-Brabant `NB`
- Noord-Holland `NH`
- Overijssel `OV`
- Utrecht `UT`
- Zeeland `ZE`
- Zuid-Holland `ZH`

# License Plates

Vehicles in the Netherlands have yellow license plates, with black text and a blue band on the left. The band bears standard the EU flag and the code `NL` for the Netherlands. License plates are required on both the front and back of cars. Dutch license plates are also a deeper shade of yellow than those found in Luxembourg and, unlike the United Kingdom, are yellow on both sides of the vehicle.

# Roads & Road Markings

Dutch pedestrian crossings are particularly distinctive, sporting parallel lines of alternating length that you will not find anywhere else. In town centers and residential areas, streets are often made of brick, and parking spots are demarcated using dashed shoulder markings. These shoulder markings can also occasionally be seen in the countryside, although unmarked roads are also common in rural areas.

# Highways & Road Numbering Schemes

The Dutch road network is one of the densest in the world, and is comprised of three layers of roads. In descending order of throughput, they are A-, N-, and S-routes, and are numbered prefixed with the respective letter.

A- and N-routes typically have kilometer markers bearing the route number on them, as shown below:

## A-routes (Autosnelwegen)

The A-routes, as controlled-access, multi-carriageway freeways, have the highest capacity of any, and typically have speed limits in excess of 100 km/h. They can be numbered up to three digits in the following format:
**{
<span style={{padding: '0.25rem', color: 'white', backgroundColor: 'red', borderRadius: '0.25rem'}}>A###</span>
}**
. They are easy to spot on the map, and only 45 such highways exist in the Netherlands. Exits are numbered sequentially. To learn more, check out [autosnelwegen.net](https://autosnelwegen.net)

## N-routes (Autowegen)

The N-routes are the most extensive of the Dutch highway networks, and are the network you will encounter most often in GeoGuessr. They can be numbered up to three digits in the following format:
**{
<span style={{padding: '0.25rem', color: 'black', backgroundColor: 'gold', borderRadius: '0.25rem'}}>N###</span>
}**
. N-routes are fairly well-ordered, although the numbering is split into two sections.

### N198 - N399

These N-routes are roughly clustered by region within the country:

- N198 - N250: West (Noord-Holland, Zuid-Holland, Utrecht)
- N251 - N300: South (Zeeland, Noord-Brabant, Limburg)
- N301 - N350: East (Gelderland, Overijssel, Flevoland)
- N351 - N399: North (Friesland, Groningen, Drenthe)

### N400 - N999

These N-routes roughly correspond to the provinces:

- N400 - N430: Utrecht
- N430 - N500: Zuid-Holland
- N500 - N550: Noord-Holland
- N550 - N600: Limburg
- N600 - N650: Noord-Brabant
- N650 - N700: Zeeland
- N700 - N730: Flevoland
- N730 - N780: Overijssel
- N780 - N850: Gelderland
- N850 - N900: Drenthe
- N900 - N950: Friesland
- N950 - N999: Groningen

## S-routes (Stadsroutes)

S-routes, or _stadsroutes_, literally translates to _city routes_, and as such are only found in specific urban areas. Only six cities currently have S-route networks: Amsterdam, Zaanstad, and Almere in the north; Rotterdam and Den Haag in the south; and Nijmegen in the east. They are all numbered with three digits, and numbers begin with 1 or 2. All roads numbered
**{
<span style={{padding: '0.25rem', color: 'black', backgroundColor: '#EEE', borderRadius: '0.25rem'}}>S100</span>
}** are inner-city ring roads; there is typically no pattern to the other S-routes.

# Language

Dutch is the official language of the Netherlands, and as such is the primary language seen in the Netherlands, although English is also commonly seen on signs, especially in urban, touristy areas. It is easy to tell apart from both English and German, its two closest linguistic relatives, as it typically contains more double-vowel sequences than both languages, and can seem like a combination of the two languages.

## Alphabet

Dutch uses the 26 letters of the standard Latin alphabet, plus an additional digraph _IJ_ which is a distinctive feature of the language.
