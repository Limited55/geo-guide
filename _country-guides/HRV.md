# License Plates

As a member of the EU, Croatia's license plates feature a blue band on the left side of the plate with the EU circle of stars and the country code `HR`. Plates are white with black text: <LicensePlate style="eu" code="HR" format="AB∇123-CD"/>. The first two characters represent the city of registration for the vehicle, and are followed by the Croatian coat of arms (represented by a `∇` above).
