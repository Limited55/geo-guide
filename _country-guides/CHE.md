# License Paltes

Swiss License plates are white with black lettering. Since Switzerland is not in the EU, the swiss plates do not have a blue strip. Instead, they have, goinf from left to right, the coat of arms of Switzerland, then a 2 letter abbreviation of the canton, the car is registered in, then a number with up to 6 digits, then the coat of arms of the canton. This makes swiss license plates different from canton to canton but in terms of Geoguessr useless because of the blur. In contrast to other European countries, Switzerland also has high, not only wide versions. Diplomatic vehicles have a green `CD` or `CC` on the left. They are often seen around Bern (becuase of the embassies) and Geneva (because of the UN). Utility vehicle registration plates are blue, agricultural vehicle registration plates are green, military vehicles have black plates and mopeds, segways and E-Bikes have yellow plates.

# Roads & Roadmarkings

2 lane roas have white center lines and white undashed side lines. 1 lane roads only rarely have any roadmarkings. The swiss pedestrian crossings are long and thick yellow lines. The Swiss bollards are usually but not only round and always white. In winter coverage, you can find wooden snow bollards with usually orange painting on the tip. On highways, you will find kilometer markers with the road numbers on the middle guard rail.

# Architecture

In Switzerland there are 4 general tips for architecture. Note that these are all tendencies. There are always exceptions!
1. The Mittelland has loads of detached houses, in the suburbs especially. They are often similar in style.
2. The Ticino pink. In the canton of Ticino are a lot of pink houses. Besides that, the houses have a strong italian influence.
3. Swiss Chalets. One other thing, Switzerland is famous for are the Chalets. Usually in alpine regions, always wooden and always looking similar (Disclaimer: AT, FR and IT have sometimes similar buildings).
4. Grison style. The Grison farm houses are often white or stoney around the ground floor and wooden on top (this is not limited to GR but very common there). Houses in villages often have paintings on their facades. This meta doesn't work for bigger towns like Chur, Davos, St Moritz and similar.

There are of course other things to watch out for concerning the architecture. The following tips are more vibebased and are usually harder to spot.
Around the Jura (JU, NE, BE, SO, VD) mountains (western border with France) the architecture is very french influenced. 
In the hilly Emmental (BE) farm houses are typically wooden and have red flowers in front of their windows. (This is not limited to BE but very common there.)
In rural Valais houses are often vertically split into wood and white facade. (Unlike GR where they are horizontally split.)
In the cantons of Thuragu, St Gallen, AR, AI houses with wooden joists are very common.

# Languages

1. German (without the Esszett)
