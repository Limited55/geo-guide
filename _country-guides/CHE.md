#License Paltes

Swiss License plates are white with black lettering. Since Switzerland is not in the EU, the swiss plates do not have a blue strip. Instead, they have, goinf from left to right, the coat of arms of Switzerland, then a 2 letter abbreviation of the canton, the car is registered in, then a number with up to 6 digits, then the coat of arms of the canton. This makes swiss license plates different from canton to canton but in terms of Geoguessr useless because of the blur. In contrast to other European countries, Switzerland also has high, not only wide versions. Diplomatic vehicles have a green `CD` or `CC` on the left. They are often seen around Bern (becuase of the embassies) and Geneva (because of the UN). Utility vehicle registration plates are blue, agricultural vehicle registration plates are green, military vehicles have black plates and mopeds, segways and E-Bikes have yellow plates.

#Roads & Roadmarkings

2 lane roas have white center lines and white undashed side lines. 1 lane roads only rarely have any roadmarkings. The swiss pedestrian crossings are long and thick yellow lines. The Swiss bollards are usually but not only round and always white. In winter coverage, you can find wooden snow bollards with usually orange painting on the tip. On highways, you will find kilometer markers with the road numbers on the middle guard rail.
