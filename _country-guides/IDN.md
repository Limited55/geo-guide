# Subdivisions

Indonesia is divided into four layers of administration:

- Provinces (_Provinsi_)
- Regencies (_Kabupaten_)
- Districts (_Kecamatan_)
- Villages (_Desa_)

Typically, only the middle two are printed on signs (and occasionally the _desa_ as well), which means it can be helpful to learn the _kabupaten_ names in addition to the provinces. Here we have organized them by region and province:
