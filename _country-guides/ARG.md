# Language

Spanish is the _de facto_ official language of Argentina, and is the language you will encounter most often. It is characterized by its use of the tilde on top of an N, and the use of inverted punctuation at the beginning of phrases. There are several recognized regional languages in various provinces:

- Guaraní in Corrientes
- Quechua in Santiago del Estero
- Qom, Mocoví, and Wichí in Chaco
- Welsh in Chubut

## Script

Spanish uses the 26 standard letters of the Latin alphabet, plus one extra character (`Ññ`):

```
Aa Bb Cc Dd Ee Ff Gg Hh Ii
Jj Kk Ll Mm Nn Ññ Oo Pp Qq
Rr Ss Tt Uu Vv Ww Xx Yy Zz
```

In addition, Spanish employs the acute accent over vowels:

```
Áá Éé Íí Óó Úú
```

Spanish is also notable for using inverted exclamation and question marks at the beginning of their respective phrases:

```
¡...!
¿...?
```

## Sample

> Todos los seres humanos nacen libres e iguales en dignidad y derechos y, dotados como están de razón y conciencia, deben comportarse fraternalmente los unos con los otros.
