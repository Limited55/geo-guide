# Licence Plates

As a member of the EU, Sweden's licence plates feature a blue band on the left side of the plate with the EU circle of stars and the country code `S`. Plates are white with black text: <LicencePlate style="eu" code="S" format="ABC 123"/>. Licence plates are required on both the front and rear of vehicles.

2. Central (`U`, `W`, and `X`)
3. Southwest (`F`, `N`, and `O`)
4. Southeast (`G`, `H`, `I`, `K`, and `O`)

# Roads, Markings, and Signage

# Highways & Road Numbering Schemes

Sweden has two highway systems: European roads, and national roads (riksväg). There is a county road (länsväg) system but this is not usually signed. They are signposted with white text on a blue background, and with a white border: **{
<span style={{padding: '0.25rem', color: 'white', backgroundColor: 'dodgerblue', borderRadius: '0.25rem'}}>###</span>
}**. They have two or three digits, and the numbering generally increases going north.

> Aa Bb Cc Dd Ee Ff Gg Hh Ii Jj Kk Ll Mm Nn Oo Pp Qq Rr Ss Tt Uu Vv Ww Xx Yy Zz Åå Ää Öö

## Sample

> Alla människor är födda fria och lika i värdighet och rättigheter. De är utrustade med förnuft och samvete och bör handla gentemot varandra i en anda av broderskap.
