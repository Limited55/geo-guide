# License Plates

As a member of the EU, Poland's license plates feature a blue band on the left side of the plate with the EU circle of stars and the country code `PL`. Plates are white with black text: <LicensePlate style="eu" code="PL" format="AB 12345"/>. The first two or three letters represent the _powiat_ of registration, and the first letter of that code represents the _powiat_'s voivodeship.
