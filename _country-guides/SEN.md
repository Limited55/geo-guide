# License Plates

Until 2019, Senegalese license plates were blue with white text: <LicensePlate style="sen" format="AB-1234-BC" text="white" bg="blue" border="lightgray"/>. The first two letters correspond to the region code, that can be found using the [subdivisions](#subdivisions) list above.

In 2019, a new EU-style plate was introduced with white plates and a blue bar on the left featuring the Senegalese flag and country code `SN`: <LicensePlate style="eu" code="SN" format="AB∙123∙BC"/>. On these plates, the region code is not part of the registration number, but rather is printed (with the department code) on the top right corner of the plate in a smaller size.

# Phone Codes

Senegal does not have an extensive area code system, with just two codes: phone numbers starting with `8` are in Dakar, and those starting with `9` are outside of Dakar.

# Language

French is the official language of Senegal, although it is not the most widely spoken — that crown goes to Wolof — it is the language you will encounter most often on signage.

## Script

The French language uses the 26 standard letters of the Latin alphabet, plus a variety of diacritics and some special letters:

```
Aa Bb Cc Dd Ee Ff Gg Hh Ii
Jj Kk Ll Mm Nn Oo Pp Qq Rr
Ss Tt Uu Vv Ww Xx Yy Zz
```

#### (Diacritics)

```
Àà Ââ Ææ Çç Éé Èè Êê Ëë
Îî Ïï Ôô Œœ Ùù Ûû Üü Ÿÿ
```

## Samples
