# License Plates

Like the United States, Canadian license plates differ in design and serial format from province to province and territory to territory. Only four provinces (British Columbia, Manitoba, Ontario, and New Brunswick) require both front and rear license plates; rhe remainder only require rear plates.

# Phone Codes

Canada is part of the [North American Numbering Plan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_American_Numbering_Plan), which consists of all countries with the `+1` country calling code. There is largely no pattern to the area codes. Area codes are three digits long, and the most populated regions have multiple area codes:

<img src="/img/CAN/phone-codes.png" />

- Territories: `867`
- British Columbia: `236`/`778`
  - Vancouver: `604`
  - All Other: `250`
- Alberta: `587`/`825`
  - North: `780`
  - South: `403`
- Saskatchewan: `306`/`639`
- Manitoba: `204`/`431`
- New Brunswick: `506`
- Nova Scotia and P.E.I.: `902`/`782`
- Newfoundland and Labrador: `709`
- Ontario: (_no province-wide code_)
  - Toronto: `416`/`437`/`647`
  - West: `807`
  - Central: `705`/`249`
  - South: `905`/`289`/`365`
  - Southwest: `519`/`226`/`548`
  - Southeast: `613`/`343`
- Québec: (_no province-wide code_)
  - Montréal: `514`/`438`
  - South: `450`/`579`
  - West: `819`/`873`
  - East: `418`/`367`/`581`

# Roads, Signage, and Poles

## Road Markings

Road markings in Canada are very similar to that of the United States, with yellow centerlines and white shoulder lines. Centerlines are usually double solid or single dashed—both common in the U.S. as well—but can occasionally be single solid, which is much rarer in the U.S.

<img src="/img/CAN/road-markings.png" className="w-full" />

The province of Alberta in particular also has white bollards with two black stripes at road intersections, which cannot be found in other provinces.

## Signage

Signage on roads is mostly standardized, but can occasionally differ, especially in Ontario and Québec.

### Stop Signs

The standard stop sign used in Canada is the same as that used in the United States, with the word "STOP" in white text on a red octagon:

<img className="mx-auto" width="256" src="/img/CAN/signage/stop-signs/default-en.png" />

Other varieties in use are as follows:

- **French**

  _Used in Québec_

  <img src="/img/CAN/signage/stop-signs/quebec-fr.png" />

- **Bilingual English/French**

  _Used in Ottawa `ON` and New Brunswick_

  <img src="/img/CAN/signage/stop-signs/bilingual-en-fr.png" />

- **Bilingual Inuktitut/English**

  _Used in Iqaluit `NU`_

  <img src="/img/CAN/signage/stop-signs/bilingual-iqaluit.png" />

- **Bilingual English/Inuinnaqtun**

  _Used in Cambridge Bay / Iqaluktuuttiaq `NU`_

  <img src="/img/CAN/signage/stop-signs/bilingual-cambridgebay.png" />

### Speed Limits

Notably, speed limit signage in Canada differs fromt hat of the United States in that it uses the word "Maximum", as opposed to "Speed Limit" in the U.S., which can be helpful in distinguishing the two countries. In addition, speed limits in Canada are marked in _kilometers per hour_ (km/h) which can help in distinguishing it as well, since the limits themselves are almost always in multiples of 10. While it is common to see a 40 mph or 40 km/h speed limit in the U.S. and Canada, respectively, highways in the U.S. typically have speed limits ending in `5` (for instance, 55 mph or 65 mph) while their Canadian counterparts are usually 90 km/h or 100 km/h.

<img className="mx-auto" width="256" src="/img/CAN/signage/speed-limits/default.png" />

There are two main deviations from this design, shown below:

- **Ontario**

  <img src="/img/CAN/signage/speed-limits/ontario.png" />

- **Québec**

  <img src="/img/CAN/signage/speed-limits/quebec-min.png" />

  _Used only on autoroutes, under "Maximum" signs_

### Road Names

French road names typically come _after_ the road type; as such, they are usually prefixed with _Rue_ (road), _Bd_ (boulevard), _Av._ (avenue), or _Pl_ (place). Cardinal numbers in French are typically shortened with an `e`—so 42nd Avenue in Montréal would be signposted as _42e Avenue_.

In Ottawa `ON`, New Brunswick, and P.E.I., street signs are usually bilingual, and so bear both the English and French names of the road on the same sign. So Orange Street, for instance, would be signposted as _Rue **Orange** St_., since _Rue Orange_ and _Orange St_ read as the French and English street names, respectively.

# Highways & Road Numbering Schemes

The Canadian highway network is highly decentralized, with nearly all highways being managed by the provinces themselves. Most roads are signposted as provincial routes, and the Trans-Canada Highway is mostly built on top of existing provincial routes.

## Trans-Canada Highway

The Trans-Canada Highway system forms the only major, signed national highway network. It is typically signposted with a white maple leaf on a green sign, with minor variations in three provinces:

<img className="mx-auto" width="256" src="/img/CAN/signage/highways/tch-default.png" />

Other varieties of signage are shown below:

- **British Columbia**

  <img src="/img/CAN/signage/highways/tch-bc.png" />

- **Québec**

  <img src="/img/CAN/signage/highways/tch-qc.png" />

- **Newfoundland**

  <img src="/img/CAN/signage/highways/tch-nl.png" />

The main route runs west-east from Victoria `BC` to St. John's `NL`, mostly signed either as Highway 1 (western four provinces, P.E.I., and Newfoundland) or a numberless route (Ontario and Québec). New Brunswick sign the route as Highway 2, and Nova Scotia signs it as Highways 104 and 105. Asides from the main route, Highway 16 is another major highway on the network, running north of Highway 1 in the western four provinces. Other routes on the network are minor, mostly as alternate routes in Ontario and Québec, plus the Highway 100 ring road in Winnipeg `MB`.

## Provincial Highways and Roads

### Alberta

Highways in Alberta are divided into two series: core highways, signposted as a white squared bullet; and local highways, signposted in a white oval. Both types are also typically signposted with a stylized "Alberta" wordmark on top.

- **Core Highways**

  - <RoadNumber style="square-bullet" num="1" border="black"/> - <RoadNumber style="square-bullet" num="100" border="black"/>: Intercity routes
  - <RoadNumber style="square-bullet" num="201" border="black"/> and <RoadNumber style="square-bullet" num="216" border="black"/>: Orbital/Ring routes

- **Local Routes**

  - <RoadNumber style="oval" num="500" border="black"/> - <RoadNumber style="oval" num="699" border="black"/>: West-East routes
  - <RoadNumber style="oval" num="700" border="black"/> - <RoadNumber style="oval" num="899" border="black"/>: South-North routes
  - <RoadNumber style="oval" num="9xx" border="black"/> and X-series: Route extensions and realignments

### British Columbia

### Manitoba

### New Brunswick

### Newfoundland and Labrador

### Nova Scotia

### Ontario

### Prince Edward Island

# Geography

The geography of Canada varies immensely from west to east. These are teh geographic macroregions of Canada, with the rough region:

- **Rockies and Coast Mountains**

  _British Columbia and western Alberta_

  This region is densely forested, and has Canada's highest peaks. It looks similar to the United States' Pacific Northwest.

- **Prairies**

  _Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Manitoba_

  This region is incredibly flat, with mostly straight roads and nearly no landform features. It also bears almost no forests or trees across the landscape.

- **Canadian Shield**

  _Northern Ontario and Québec, Labrador, and far-northern Prairies_

  This region is fairly forested, and has thousands of lakes dotting the landscape.

- **Great Lakes and St. Lawrence**

  _Southern Ontario and Québec_

  The most densely populated region of Canada, this region is similarly flat to the Prairies, but contains more forest and shrubbery, and overall possesses more greenery. Also contains Canada's wine region, and has lots of farming.

- **Maritimes**

  _New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, P.E.I., and Newfoundland_

  Part of the Appalachians, this region contains some mountains, although none as big as those on the west coast. This area is densely forested as well, and looks similar to New England, especially in the southern reaches.

- **Northern Canada**

  _Yukon, Northwest Territories, and Nunavut_

  These areas have a very variable geography, with some larger mountains in the west near the borders with British Columbia and Alaska, and cold, lake-ridden landscapes in teh center and east. The northernmost reaches, including the Canadian Arctic, are the coldest parts of Canada, and are often covered with snow.

# Language

English and French are co-official languages in Canada at the federal level, with only one monolingually French province (Québec) and one officially bilingual province (New Brunswick). All other provinces use English as the primary language, whether official or _de facto_. The three territories, being federally governed, have English and French as co-official languages, but N.W.T., and Nunavut have a variety of indigenous languages that share official status.

## Script

Both English and French use the 26 standard letters of the Latin alphabet:

```
Aa Bb Cc Dd Ee Ff Gg Hh Ii
Jj Kk Ll Mm Nn Oo Pp Qq Rr
Ss Tt Uu Vv Ww Xx Yy Zz
```

In addition, French employs several accents and diacritics, shown below:

```
Àà Ââ Ææ Çç Éé Èè Êê Ëë
Îî Ïï Ôô Œœ Ùù Ûû Üü Ÿÿ
```

## Samples

### English

> All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights. They are endowed with reason and conscience and should act towards one another in a spirit of brotherhood.

### French

> Tous les êtres humains naissent libres et égaux en dignité et en droits. Ils sont doués de raison et de conscience et doivent agir les uns envers les autres dans un esprit de fraternité.
